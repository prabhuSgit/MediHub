# MediHub

Medihub is the JAVA application Project that was completed in my first semester of my MS. The applcation helps a user to register himself as a patient and consult the doctor by viewing thei availability and schedule. The doctor can register themselves as well with the applciation and list their scehdule. Similar to which a Hospital may register itself and maintain the list of Doctors under them. There is a data visualzation included in the application which shows the number of Doctors and the stats of patients based on the appointments booked.

The application was still under developement and is at its initial stage. But, building this application gave me a good insight in data base management and integrating the features with a JAVA applicaiton in visualizing the data in a better way using basic JAVA
